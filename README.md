# wharton-investment-competition25-26
As the team lead for my school in the Wharton Global High School Investment Competition, I designed the investment strategy and built the quantitative models. This repo contains my code that has enabled my team to advance to the Semifinalist round (top 50/6300 teams). I am currently leading my team through a pitch presentation and technical Q&A before a professional review panel of asset managers.

Our task was to construct an investment strategy that aligned with a Wharton alumnus client’s financial objectives and ESG priorities.
